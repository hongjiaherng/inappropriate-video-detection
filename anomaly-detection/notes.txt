Dataset preprocessing

train
for each video:
- all clip features of a video ->
- if more than threshold (200), uniformly sample 200 clips features, otherwise, take all but zero pad to 200 ->
- generate video-level label, 0 or 1

test
for each video:
- take whole video don't care about number of clips
- generate ground truth label


- say options first

- dataset whether streaming or not
    - should always shuffle train Dataset, apply a preprocessing to input
    - should not shuffle test Dataset and batch size of 5 to load all crops of a video at once, apply a preprocessing to target
